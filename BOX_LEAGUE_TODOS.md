# Box League - Comprehensive Todo List

## Analysis Summary

**Backend Logic:** ‚úÖ Promotion/relegation logic exists and is well-implemented
**Frontend UI:** ‚úÖ Cycle completion workflow now complete! Missing: player management edge cases
**Player Management:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic features work, but edge cases (mid-round swaps, withdrawals) not handled
**Validation:** ‚úÖ Cycle completion validation now properly checks for pending matches
**Progress:** 11/40 tasks complete (28%)

---

## Phase 1: Critical Bug Fixes (High Priority) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Fix box creation flow - create boxes atomically with league
  - **Issue**: Boxes are created via useEffect, not atomically with league creation
  - **Files**: `src/lib/box-leagues.ts`
  - **Action**: Add batch box creation in `createBoxLeague` function
  - **COMPLETED**: Modified `createBoxLeague()` at line 48 to use Firestore batch writes. League and all boxes now created atomically in single transaction.

- [x] Fix useEffect infinite loop risk in box management
  - **Issue**: Dependencies in box-management useEffect could cause infinite re-creation
  - **Files**: `src/app/box-leagues/[id]/boxes/box-management-client.tsx`
  - **Action**: Refactor useEffect to use ref-based guard or better dependency array
  - **COMPLETED**: Removed auto-create boxes useEffect at line 270. No longer needed since boxes are created atomically with league.

- [x] Fix user ID inconsistency in box league creation
  - **Issue**: Uses `user.id || user.uid || ''` - unclear which is correct
  - **Files**: `src/app/box-leagues/create/create-box-league-client.tsx`
  - **Action**: Use consistent user ID field, add validation
  - **COMPLETED**: Changed to use only `user.id` at line 41. Added null check `if (!user?.id)` for validation. User interface only has `id` field, not `uid`.

- [x] Implement head-to-head tiebreaker in standings calculation
  - **Issue**: Currently skipped in standings calculation
  - **Files**: `src/lib/box-league-logic.ts` (line 182-183)
  - **Action**: Complete the tiebreaker logic for 2-way ties
  - **COMPLETED**: Implemented 2-way tie head-to-head comparison logic at lines 182-198. When exactly 2 players tied on points, head-to-head record now determines ranking.

---

## Phase 2: Database & Performance (High Priority) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Add Firebase composite indexes configuration
  - **Issue**: Queries using orderBy + where will fail without indexes
  - **Files**: Create `firestore.indexes.json` in project root
  - **Action**: Add all required composite indexes for box league queries
  - **COMPLETED**: Created `firestore.indexes.json` with 3 composite indexes for boxLeagueMatches and boxLeaguePlayerStats collections. Indexes cover: 1) matches by boxId + cycle/round/matchNumber, 2) stats by playerId + boxLeagueId, 3) stats by boxId + currentPosition.

- [x] Fix race condition in stats updates using transactions
  - **Issue**: Multiple simultaneous match completions could corrupt stats
  - **Files**: `src/lib/box-leagues.ts`
  - **Action**: Wrap `updatePlayerStatsAfterMatch` in Firestore transaction
  - **COMPLETED**: Refactored `createOrUpdatePlayerStats` at line 325 to use Firestore transactions with deterministic document IDs (`{boxLeagueId}_{playerId}`). This ensures atomic read-modify-write operations, preventing data corruption from simultaneous match completions.

---

## Phase 3: Core Missing Features (HIGH PRIORITY) üî¥

---

## Phase 6: Critical Bug Fixes (IMMEDIATE) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### 6.1 Firebase Index Error (BLOCKING)

- [x] Fix missing Firebase indexes
  - **Issue**: Match result recording fails with "query requires an index" error
  - **Current Error**: `getPlayerStatsByBox` query requires composite index
  - **Files**: `firestore.indexes.json`, Firebase Console
  - **Action**:
    1. Verify `firestore.indexes.json` is correctly formatted
    2. Deploy indexes: `firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes`
    3. Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore ‚Üí Indexes for index status
    4. May need to manually create index via error link in console
    5. Required index: `boxLeaguePlayerStats` collection:
       - `boxId` (ASC)
       - `currentPosition` (ASC)
    6. Add deployment instructions to README
    7. Add index creation check to league setup workflow
  - **COMPLETED**: Created composite index via Firebase Console. Index includes `boxId` (ASC), `currentPosition` (ASC), `__name__` (ASC). Match results now save successfully.

### 6.2 UI Cache Invalidation Bug

- [x] Fix UI not updating after match result recorded
  - **Issue**: After recording match result, UI doesn't refresh until page reload
  - **Symptom**: "Record Result" button remains visible even after match completed
  - **Files**: `src/hooks/use-box-leagues.ts`, `src/app/box-leagues/[id]/rounds/round-management-client.tsx`
  - **Root Cause**: React Query cache invalidation only worked if IDs were in `updates` object, but they weren't being passed
  - **COMPLETED**:
    - Modified `useUpdateBoxLeagueMatch` hook to accept optional `match` parameter
    - Hook now extracts IDs from match object and invalidates all relevant queries
    - Updated round-management component to pass full match object to mutation
    - UI now updates immediately after recording match results without page refresh

### 6.3 Data Validation

- [ ] Add comprehensive bounds checking
  - **Issue**: Missing validation could lead to corrupt data

  - **Action**:
    - Prevent negative scores in match results
    - Validate player IDs exist before adding to box
    - Check box capacity (max 4) before adding players
    - Validate roundNumber and cycleNumber are positive integers
    - Ensure boxNumber is within league's totalBoxes range
    - Add Firestore security rules for server-side validation
    - Add Zod schemas for type-safe validation
